    "### I. Fundamentals of CNNs and Image Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. How does convolution work in CNNs?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Convolution is a mathematical operation that applies a filter (or kernel) to an image to extract features such as edges, textures, and patterns. In Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):\n",
    "- A small filter (e.g., 3×3 or 5×5) slides over the input image.\n",
    "- At each step, an element-wise dot product is computed between the filter and the portion of the image.\n",
    "- The result is summed up to produce a single pixel value in the output feature map.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of a 3×3 filter applied to a 5×5 image:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input Image:\n",
    "1 2 3 0 1\n",
    "4 5 6 1 2\n",
    "7 8 9 0 1\n",
    "1 2 3 4 5\n",
    "0 1 2 3 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter:\n",
    "1 0 1\n",
    "0 1 0\n",
    "1 0 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Feature Map:\n",
    "19 21 23\n",
    "27 29 31\n",
    "35 37 39\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs stack multiple convolutional layers to learn hierarchical features (edges → textures → objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. What is the difference between CNN and MLP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature            | CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) | MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) |\n",
    "|--------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n",
    "| Structure          | Uses convolutional layers to extract spatial features | Uses fully connected layers |\n",
    "| Input Type         | Works well with images             | Works with structured/tabular data |\n",
    "| Weight Sharing     | Uses shared filters to reduce parameters | Every neuron has unique weights |\n",
    "| Feature Learning   | Automatically extracts spatial features | Requires manual feature selection |\n",
    "| Performance        | More effective for image tasks     | Less effective for images    |\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs outperform MLPs for image-related tasks due to their ability to capture local spatial patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Explain max pooling and average pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Pooling is a downsampling operation that reduces the size of feature maps while retaining important information.\n",
    "- **Max Pooling:** Takes the maximum value from a small window (e.g., 2×2) → Captures strongest features.\n",
    "- **Average Pooling:** Takes the average of values in the window → Preserves smooth features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "If a 2×2 max pooling is applied to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "1 3\n",
    "4 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "4 (max value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Max pooling is commonly used because it helps retain dominant features while reducing computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object Detection and Image Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. What are object detection algorithms? How does YOLO work?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Object detection algorithms identify and localize multiple objects in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Popular algorithms:**\n",
    "- RCNN, Fast RCNN, Faster RCNN – Region-based detection.\n",
    "- YOLO (You Only Look Once) – One-stage detection, fast and efficient.\n",
    "- SSD (Single Shot Detector) – Balances speed and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How YOLO Works:**\n",
    "1. The image is divided into a grid (e.g., 13×13).\n",
    "2. Each grid cell predicts:\n",
    "   - Bounding boxes (x, y, width, height).\n",
    "   - Class probabilities (e.g., “dog” vs. “cat”).\n",
    "3. YOLO processes an image in a single pass, making it extremely fast (~30–60 FPS).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Explain the role of data augmentation in image classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Data augmentation artificially expands the training dataset by applying transformations like:\n",
    "- Rotation, flipping, scaling, cropping → Prevents overfitting.\n",
    "- Brightness adjustment, contrast change → Improves robustness.\n",
    "- Gaussian noise, blurring → Enhances generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example using OpenCV (Python):**\n",

    "cv2.imshow(\"Flipped\", flipped_img)  \n",
    "cv2.waitKey(0)  \n",
    "cv2.destroyAllWindows()  \n",
    "```\n",
    "Data augmentation is essential when training deep learning models on limited datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. How does ResNet solve the vanishing gradient problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "ResNet (Residual Network) introduces skip connections (residual connections) to solve the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "- **Issue:** In deep networks, gradients become extremely small (vanish), making training difficult.\n",
    "- **Solution:** ResNet adds identity connections:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input (x) → [Layer] → Output (F(x))\n",
    "       |________________________|\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( x \\) is the input to a layer.\n",
    "- \\( F(x) \\) is the transformation (weights, activation).\n",
    "- Adding \\( x \\) helps gradients flow directly through the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "ResNet enables training very deep networks (50, 101, 152 layers).\n",
    "\n",

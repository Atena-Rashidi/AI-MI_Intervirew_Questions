    "1. **Enhancement:** Enhances LLMs by retrieving external knowledge before generating responses.\n",
    "2. **Application:** Used in LLM-powered chatbots to provide fact-based answers by accessing up-to-date information from external sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. What is an Encoder-Only Model (Masked Language Modeling in BERT)?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "1. **Masking:** Randomly hides some words in a sentence, e.g., \"The cat [MASK] on the mat.\"\n",
    "2. **Prediction:** The model predicts the masked word \"sat\" using the context from both sides of the masked word.\n",
    "3. **Example:** BERT is an encoder-only model designed for this task, reading the entire sentence and using the context from both sides to make its prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. What are Decoder-Only Models (like GPT)?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "1. **Sequential Prediction:** Predicts the next word in a sequence using only the previous words.\n",
    "2. **Example:** For the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat,\" the model starts with \"The,\" predicts \"cat,\" then \"sat,\" and continues until the sentence is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Differences\n",
    "- **MLM (BERT):** Masks random words and predicts them using context from both sides. BERT is an encoder-only model.\n",
    "- **Decoder-Only (GPT):** Predicts the next word in a sequence using only the previous words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. What are the Differences between Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Traditional Large Language Models (LLMs)?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional LLMs\n",
    "1. **Training Data:** Static and limited to the training cutoff date.\n",
    "2. **Hallucinations:** Can produce inaccurate or outdated information.\n",
    "3. **Context Limitations:** Fixed context window size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "1. **Real-Time Information:** Fetches relevant data from external sources during inference.\n",
    "2. **Reduced Hallucinations:** Grounds responses in retrieved data, reducing inaccuracies.\n",
    "3. **Scalability:** Easily incorporates new information by updating the external knowledge base without needing to retrain the entire model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Differences\n",
    "- **Data Handling:** Traditional LLMs use only their internal training data, while RAG models augment this with real-time data retrieval.\n",
    "- **Accuracy and Relevance:** RAG models tend to be more accurate and relevant for current events or domain-specific queries because they access the latest information.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** RAG allows for easy updates by modifying the external knowledge source, whereas traditional LLMs require retraining to update their knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Scenario\n",
    "Imagine you need information about a recent scientific discovery:\n",
    "- A traditional LLM might not have this information if it was trained before the discovery occurred.\n",
    "- A RAG model can retrieve the latest research papers or articles about the discovery and provide an accurate response.\n",
    "\n",

    "2. **Scoring and Weighting:** Computes relevance scores and weights values to produce attention output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Self-Attention\n",
    "1. **Same Sequence:** Queries, keys, and values come from the same sequence.\n",
    "2. **Contextual Representation:** Transforms each element in the sequence into a new representation that captures its relationship with every other element.\n",
    "3. **Parallel Processing:** Allows for efficient processing of the entire sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Differences\n",
    "- **Source of Queries, Keys, and Values:**\n",
    "  - **Attention:** Queries, keys, and values can come from different sequences (e.g., in encoder-decoder attention, queries come from the decoder and keys/values come from the encoder).\n",
    "  - **Self-Attention:** Queries, keys, and values all come from the same sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:**\n",
    "  - **Attention:** Used to focus on relevant parts of the input or another sequence.\n",
    "  - **Self-Attention:** Used to capture dependencies within the same sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example in Transformers\n",
    "- **Encoder:** Uses self-attention to encode the input sequence.\n",
    "- **Decoder:** Uses self-attention and attention to focus on the encoder's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visual Representation\n",
    "Imagine you have a sentence: \"The cat sat on the mat.\"\n",
    "- **Self-Attention:** Each word in the sentence looks at every other word to understand the context better. For example, \"cat\" might pay attention to \"sat\" and \"mat\" to understand the action and location.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12. What is BERT?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "**BERT** stands for **Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers**. It is designed to understand the context of words in a sentence by looking at the words that come before and after them.\n",

    "1. **Transformer Encoder:** Uses multiple layers of Transformer encoders.\n",
    "2. **Bidirectional Context:** Reads the entire sequence of words at once.\n",
    "3. **Tokenization:** Uses WordPiece tokenization to handle rare and unknown words.\n",
    "4. **Pre-training Tasks:**\n",
    "   - **Masked Language Model (MLM):** Predicts masked words in a sentence.\n",
    "   - **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):** Understands the relationship between two sentences by predicting if one sentence follows another.\n",
    "\n",
